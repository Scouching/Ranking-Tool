This is a simple tool built to break a long list of names into smaller chunks and present a simple question of preference between the names in order to create a ranked order of the inputted names.
The program will prompt you to paste a list of at least 10 names separated by commas and present you with questions to choose between one or the other (A or B).
The program will then spit out the ranking of each group separately, as well as a concatenated list of names that can be copied and pasted elsewhere.
